# 2- Minikube config for this project

This is the config that I recommend for this project, actually I'm using MacOS-X Mojave.

```text
$ minikube start --driver virtualbox --cpus 4 --memory 4096
```

### Minikube Dashboard

```text
$ minikube dashboard
```

This is for easy and basic default monitoring on kubernetes on minikube.
